# Weekly Updates

Each week we post an update of what's been happening in our community to our [Slack](https://slack.lfph.io) workspace. Here you can view an archive of all our weekly updates.

## April 16, 2021

//This is the new weekly LFPH update. It includes updates from our community regarding what was achieved in the past week, and what’s coming in the week ahead. Please ping #community-ops if there are any project leads we’ve missed.

:dart: The first update is from Covid Green, they are planning a reverse contact tracing effort and interested contributors should get in touch with @colmharte. Reverse contact tracing finds Covid-19 infection vectors using data.

:dart: The second update is from the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative, via @Lucy Yang (CCI):

This week:
* Responded to the Release Candidate 1 of the WHO Interim Guidance for Developing a Smart Vaccination Certificate, which has taken into consideration comments from the community members.
* Hosted CCI Summit: From Closed Loop Systems to Open World Credentials Exchange, facilitating collaboration among existing Covid health status systems and identifying tools LFPH can build to support the collaborations.
* Had an EU-themed session on the Digital Green Certificate and strategies to a more decentralized approach at the member state level. A CCI EU subgroup is in discussion #cci-prep-eu-subgroup.

Upcoming:
* Produce a summit report summarizing the main discussions and suggest next steps
* Respond to Call for Evidence: UK Parliament Covid 19 Vaccine Certification. Join #cci-uk-call-for-evidence if you are interested in contributing
* Attend Internet Identity Workshop to share our learning from the Covid credentials space.

:dart: The third update is from Herald, a non-GAEN (Google Apple Exposure Notification) contact tracing system which specializes in high-resolution bluetooth-to-bluetooth proximity and distance measurement. It was contributed to LFPH by VMware last month under an open-source license and is similar to OpenTrace. Herald is in active development and features a watch-like wearable which is in the prototype phase. Interested contributors should contact @Ads. This project reached a major milestone with Herald integration within Alberta, Canada’s contact tracing app TraceTogether v2.0, which went live on Tuesday.

//This update was compiled by @Sara D (thank you!) and we’d love to hear from all of you in the LFPH community how to evolve this new weekly feature. Thanks for reading!
