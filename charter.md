The LF Public Health Fund Charter

The Linux Foundation

Effective July 1, 2020

#### 1. Mission and Scope of the LF Public Health Fund.

-	a) The purpose of the LF Public Health Fund (the “Directed Fund”) is to raise, budget and
spend funds in support of various open source and/or open standards projects relating to
improving public health and response to epidemics, including infrastructure and support
initiatives related thereto (each such project, a “Technical Project”). The governance of
each Technical Project is as set forth in the applicable charter for each Technical Project.

-	b) The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund operates under the
guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the “Governing Board”) and The
Linux Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s
tax-exempt status.

-	c) The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will also have an
Outreach Committee, Technical Advisory Counsel and other working groups, councils,
committees and similar bodies (collectively, “Committees”) that may be established by
the Governing Board. These committees report to the Governing Board.

#### 2. Membership.

-	a) The Directed Fund will be composed of Premier, General and Associate Members (each,
a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members”) in Good Standing. All Members must be
current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the Directed Fund as
a member. All participants in the Directed Fund, enjoy the privileges and undertake the
obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing
Board with the approval of the LF. During the term of their membership, all members
will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the Directed Fund
may adopt with notice to members.

-	b) Premier Members will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board and
any Committee.

-	c) General Members, acting as a class, will be entitled to annually elect one representative
to the Governing Board for every ten General Members, up to a maximum of three
representatives, provided that there will always be at least one General Member
representative, even if there are less than ten General Members. The Governing Board
determines the election process.

-	d) The Associate Member category of membership is limited to Associate Members of The
Linux Foundation. The Governing Board may set additional criteria for joining the
Directed Fund as an Associate Member. If the Associate Member is a membership
organization, Associate Membership in the Directed Fund does not confer any benefits or
rights to the members of the Associate Member.

-	e) Members will be entitled to:

	-	i) participate in Directed Fund general meetings, initiatives, events and any other
activities; and

	-	ii) identify themselves as members of the LF Public Health Fund supporting the LF
Public Health community.

#### 3. Governing Board.

-	a) The Governing Board voting members will consist of:

	-	i) one representative appointed by each Premier Member;
  
	-	ii) the TAC Representative (as defined herein); and
  
	-	iii) the elected General Member representative or representatives.
  
-	b) Only one Member that is part of a group of Related Companies (as defined in Section 6)
may appoint, or nominate for a membership class election, a representative on the
Governing Board. No single Member, company or set of Related Companies will be
entitled to: (i) appoint or nominate for Membership class election more than one
representative for the Governing Board, or (ii) have more than two representatives on the
Governing Board.

	-	i) Please note that it will be acceptable for one Member to appoint or nominate a
representative to the Governing Board and have another of its employees, or an
employee of one of its Related Companies, serve as the TAC Representative on the
Governing Board.

-	c) Conduct of Meetings

	-	i) Governing Board meetings will be limited to the Governing Board representatives,
the Outreach Committee Chair, invited guests and LF staff.

	-	ii) Governing Board meetings follow the requirements for quorum and voting outlined in
this Charter. The Governing Board may decide whether to allow named
representatives (one per Member per Governing Board and per Committee) to attend as an alternate.

	-	iii) The Governing Board meetings will be private unless decided otherwise by the
Governing Board. The Governing Board may invite guests to participate in
consideration of specific Governing Board topics (but such guest may not participate
in any vote on any matter before the Governing Board).
	-	iv) Each Governing Board voting member may designate one individual as an alternate for Governing Board meetings. In the case of the TAC Chair, the alternate must also be a member of the TAC. An alternate may attend Governing Board meetings, either with, or in the absence of, the Governing Board voting member. The alternate will be able to vote in the absence of the Governing Board member, and shall be counted towards quorum of the Governing Board. An alternate may not hold or perform the duties of any Governing Board role (such as Chair of the Governing Board) on behalf of the Governing Board voting member. We recommend governing board members attend the majority of governing board meetings.

-	d) Officers

	-	i) The officers (“Officers”) of the Directed Fund as of the first meeting of
the Governing Board will be a Chair (“Chair”). Additional Officer
positions may be created by the Governing Board.

	-	ii) The Chair will preside over meetings of the Governing Board and will
submit minutes for Governing Board approval.

-	e) The Governing Board will be responsible for overall management of the Directed Fund,
including:
	-	i) approve a budget directing the use of funds raised by the Directed Fund from all
sources of revenue;

	-	ii) nominate and elect Officers of the Directed Fund;
  
	-	iii) approve, in addition to TAC approval, of projects as Technical Projects;
  
	-	iv) oversee all Directed Fund business and community outreach matters and work with
the LF on any legal matters that arise;

	-	v) adopt and maintain policies or rules and procedures for the Directed Fund (subject to
LF approval);

	-	vi) establish advisory bodies, committees, programs or councils to resolve any particular
matter or in support of the mission of the Directed Fund and/or its Technical Projects
including in support of end-users and ambassadors for the project;

	-	vii) establish any conformance programs and solicit input (including testing tools) from
the applicable governance body of any Technical Project for defining and
administering any programs related to conformance with any Technical Project
(each, a “Conformance Program”);

	-	viii) publish use cases, user stories, websites and priorities to help inform the
ecosystem and technical community;

	-	ix) approve procedures for the nomination and election of any representative of the
General Members to the Governing Board and any Officer or other positions created by the Governing Board; and

	-	x) vote on all decisions or matters coming before the Governing Board.

#### 4. Outreach Committee.

-	a) The Outreach Committee is open to representatives of Premier and General Members to
contribute to the design, development and oversight of community outreach efforts on
behalf of the Governing Board. The Outreach Committee is expected to coordinate
closely with the Governing Board and technical communities to maximize the outreach
and visibility of the Technical Projects throughout the industry.

#### 5. Technical Advisory Council.

-	a) The role of the TAC is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the
Technical Projects. The TAC will be responsible for:

	-	i) coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an
overall technical vision for the community;

	-	ii) electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings,
ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as
the TAC’s representative (the “TAC Representative”);

	-	iii) creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes,
subject to the approval of the Governing Board; and

	-	iv) such other matters related to the technical role of the TAC as may be communicated
to the TAC by the Governing Board.

-	b) The voting members of the TAC consist of:

	-	i) one representative appointed by each Premier Member; and
  
	-	ii) one representative appointed by the technical oversight body (e.g., a technical
steering committee) of each TAC Project (as defined herein).

-	c) One representative of any Member may observe meetings of the TAC. Any committers
from a TAC Project may observe meetings of the TAC. The TAC may change this at any
point in time, including: (a) opening meetings to a broader community; (b) holding closed
meetings; and (c) holding meetings open to the public.

-	d) At the start of the Directed Fund, “TAC Projects” are those Technical Projects listed as
having voting representatives on the TAC on the Directed Fund’s web site. Thereafter,
any Technical Project can become a TAC Project through the approval of the Technical
Project’s technical oversight body, the TAC (by a two-third’s vote), and the Governing
Board. The TAC and the Governing Board may approve a project lifecycle policy that
will address the incubation, archival and other stages of TAC Projects.

-	e) The TAC representatives will elect a chair to preside over meetings, ensure minutes are
taken and drive the TAC agenda with input from the TAC representatives.

#### 6. Voting.

-	a) Quorum for Governing Board and Committee meetings will require at least fifty percent
of the voting representatives. If advance notice of the meeting has been given per normal
means and timing, the Governing Board may continue to meet even if quorum is not met,
but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

-	b) Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus. If, however, any decision requires a
vote to move forward, the representatives of the Governing Board or Committee, as
applicable, will vote on a one vote per voting representative basis.

-	c) Except as provided in Section 16.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote at a
meeting will require a simple majority vote, provided quorum is met. Except as provided
in Section 16.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by electronic vote without a
meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.

-	d) In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the
Governing Board, the Chair may refer the matter to the LF for assistance in reaching a
decision. If there is a tied vote in any Committee that cannot be resolved, the matter may
be referred to the Governing Board.

#### 7. Subsidiaries and Related Companies.

-	a) Definitions:

	-	i) “Subsidiaries” means any entity in which a Member owns, directly or indirectly, more
than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in
question;

	-	ii) “Related Company” means any entity which controls or is controlled by a Member or
which, together with a Member, is under the common control of a third party, in each
case where such control results from ownership, either directly or indirectly, of more
than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in
question; and

	-	iii) “Related Companies” are entities that are each a Related Company of a Member.

-	b) Only the legal entity which has executed a Participation Agreement and its Subsidiaries
will be entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of such Membership; provided,
however, that such Member and its Subsidiaries will be treated together as a single
Member.

-	c) If a Member is itself a foundation, association, consortium, open source project,
membership organization, user group or other entity that has members or sponsors, then
the rights and privileges granted to such Member will extend only to the
employee-representatives of such Member, and not to its members or sponsors, unless
otherwise approved by the Governing Board in a specific case.

-	d) Directed Fund Membership is non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except a
Member may transfer its current Membership benefits and obligations to a successor of
substantially all of its business or assets, whether by merger, sale or otherwise; provided
that the transferee agrees to be bound by this Charter and the Bylaws and policies
required by LF membership.

#### 8. Good Standing.

-	a) The Linux Foundation’s Good Standing Policy is available at
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/good-standing-policy and will apply to Members of this
Directed Fund.

#### 9. Trademarks.

limitation any mark relating to any Conformance Program, must be transferred to and

#### 10. Antitrust Guidelines.

-	a) All Members must abide by The Linux Foundation’s Antitrust Policy available at
http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy.

-	b) All Members must encourage open participation from any organization able to meet the
membership requirements, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the
Governing Board will not seek to exclude any member based on any criteria,
requirements or reasons other than those that are reasonable and applied on a
non-discriminatory basis to all members.

#### 11. Budget.

-	a) The Governing Board will approve an annual budget and never commit to spend in
excess of funds raised. The budget and the purposes to which it is applied must be
consistent with both (a) the non-profit and tax-exempt mission of The Linux Foundation
and (b) the aggregate goals of the Technical Projects.

-	b) The Linux Foundation will provide the Governing Board with regular reports of spend
levels against the budget. Under no circumstances will The Linux Foundation have any
expectation or obligation to undertake an action on behalf of the Directed Fund or
otherwise related to the Directed Fund that is not covered in full by funds raised by the
Directed Fund.

-	c) In the event an unbudgeted or otherwise unfunded obligation arises related to the
Directed Fund, The Linux Foundation will coordinate with the Governing Board to
address gap funding requirements.

#### 12. General & Administrative Expenses.

-	a) The Linux Foundation will have custody of and final authority over the usage of any fees,
funds and other cash receipts.

-	b) A General & Administrative (G&A) fee will be applied by The Linux Foundation to
funds raised to cover membership records, finance, accounting, and human resources
operations. The G&A fee will be 9% of the Directed Fund’s first $1,000,000 of gross
receipts each year and 6% of the Directed Fund’s gross receipts each year over
$1,000,000.

#### 13. General Rules and Operations.

cohesive community, while also maintaining the goodwill and esteem of The Linux
Foundation in the open source community;

-	b) respect the rights of all trademark owners, including any branding and usage guidelines;

-	c) engage or coordinate with The Linux Foundation on all outreach, website and marketing
activities regarding the Directed Fund or on behalf of any Technical Project that invoke
or associate the name of any Technical Project or The Linux Foundation; and

-	d) operate under such rules and procedures as may be approved by the Governing Board and
confirmed by The Linux Foundation.

#### 14. Amendments.

-	a) This Charter may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the entire Governing Board, subject
to approval by The Linux Foundation.
