## April 30, 2021

//This is the LFPH Weekly Update. It includes updates from our community regarding what was achieved in the past week, and what’s coming in the week ahead. Interested contributors should contact the project leads listed here.

:one: The first update is from Herald, which released a new version and is also running under a new twitter handle @HeraldProximity. Via Adam Fowler @Adam:
New in Herald v1.3

* Detection of other Digital Contact Tracing (#DCT) protocols and payloads. To facilitate interoperability across borders, Herald now also detects BlueTrace based apps and GAEN based apps and logs their contacts on your phone/wearable.
* Exposure Risk estimation support. We’ve implemented a basic log-distance risk integration function to calculate an exposure score for each nearby device running Herald.
* Wearables and beacons! Thanks to @mishkathebear Herald now has some great opensource hardware designs. We have designs for DCT wearables, eHealth monitoring wearables, and Bluetooth MESH beacons.
* Distance Conversion from Bluetooth RSSI. See the distance between two phones running the Herald demo app. A similar feature may appear in your country’s #DCT app soon.
* Analysis API for all platforms. Allows scientists to create, test, and deploy data analysis algorithms to mobile phones and wearables. Immediate uses are accurate and regular distance conversion from RSSI, and risk calculation for COVID-19 and Ebola.

:two: The second update is from the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative, via @Lucy Yang (CCI):

This week: 
* Two open source proposals, ProofMarket’s Medcreds and Indicio.Tech’s Cardea were approved by the Technical Advisory Committee and accepted into LFPH as two projects. More details to come soon.
* CCI released the summary report of its summit: From Closed Loop Systems to Open World COVID Credentials Exchange.
* CCI Use Case Implementation Workstream hosted a well-attended call (recording here), featuring two presentations: South Korea’s national vaccination verification system and Mapping FHIR to JSON-LD with W3C Vaccination Vocabulary

Upcoming:
* Consolidate community input and submit response to Call for Evidence: UK Parliament Covid 19 Vaccine Certification.
* CCI Schema Task Force is hosting an ad-hoc call on Monday at 10 am PT/5 pm UTC to go through the EU-defined minimum viable value sets for the following COVID-19 profile credentials: vaccination credential, test credential, and recovery credential.

:three: The third update is from Covid Green via @colmharte. They are adding support for Huawei’s contact tracing software.

:four: And the fourth update is from #sig-design via @Elle Marcus, which began design on a vaccine credentials app based on QR codes and are looking for developers.

:sparkles:  As always many thanks to @Sara D for putting this together! Anyone interested in helping grow our community and make LFPH a better place should head over to #community-ops.

*  The first update is from @Elle Marcus with the #sig-design group. Sig design completed a user survey of mobile tickets and mobile wallets to provide insight into user interaction with vaccine credential applications. The survery found that 75% of users perfer mobile tickets to paper tickets, though 82% of users perfer physical credit cards to mobile wallet applications. Interested contributors should join #sig-design
*  The second update is from the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative, via @Lucy Yang (CCI):

* This week: 
    * Two CCI participating organizations, ProofMarket and Indicio.Tech submitted their proposals [1] [2] to contribute code to LFPH and presented to the Technical Advisory Committee (recording here).

* Upcoming:
    * CCI Use Case Implementation Workstream Call next Tuesday (7 am PT/ 2pm UTC) will host two presentations: Blockchain Labs to demonstrate South Korea’s newly launched national vaccination certificate system and @John Walker to present his work in “Mapping FHIR to JSON-LD with W3C Vaccination Vocabulary”.
Call for Evidence: UK Parliament Covid 19 Vaccine Certification is still open for community input. Join #cci-uk-call-for-evidence if you are interested in contributing.
    * Summary report to come soon for CCI Summit: From Closed Loop Systems to Open World Credentials Exchange.
*  The third update is from Herald, which had a well attended webinar on Thursday on the value of non-GAEN exposure notification, led by @Adam. Recording here.
*  The fourth update is from Covid Green, which is improving chaff support and other network security maintenance via @colmharte.
*  And the fifth update is from @Thomas Augsten [DE] SAP with the #qr-venue-checkin group. They are working on presence tracing, which addresses the potential for airborne transmission of Covid-19 in indoor spaces by notifying someone of potential exposure if they have been to the same venue at a similar time as a positively tested individual. Interested contributors should join #qr-venue-checkin. Github summary here https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/master/event_registration.md

## April 16, 2021

//This is the new weekly LFPH update. It includes updates from our community regarding what was achieved in the past week, and what’s coming in the week ahead. Please ping #community-ops if there are any project leads we’ve missed.

:dart: The first update is from Covid Green, they are planning a reverse contact tracing effort and interested contributors should get in touch with @colmharte. Reverse contact tracing finds Covid-19 infection vectors using data.

:dart: The second update is from the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative, via @Lucy Yang (CCI):

This week:
* Responded to the Release Candidate 1 of the WHO Interim Guidance for Developing a Smart Vaccination Certificate, which has taken into consideration comments from the community members.
* Hosted CCI Summit: From Closed Loop Systems to Open World Credentials Exchange, facilitating collaboration among existing Covid health status systems and identifying tools LFPH can build to support the collaborations.
* Had an EU-themed session on the Digital Green Certificate and strategies to a more decentralized approach at the member state level. A CCI EU subgroup is in discussion #cci-prep-eu-subgroup.

Upcoming:
* Produce a summit report summarizing the main discussions and suggest next steps
* Respond to Call for Evidence: UK Parliament Covid 19 Vaccine Certification. Join #cci-uk-call-for-evidence if you are interested in contributing
* Attend Internet Identity Workshop to share our learning from the Covid credentials space.

:dart: The third update is from Herald, a non-GAEN (Google Apple Exposure Notification) contact tracing system which specializes in high-resolution bluetooth-to-bluetooth proximity and distance measurement. It was contributed to LFPH by VMware last month under an open-source license and is similar to OpenTrace. Herald is in active development and features a watch-like wearable which is in the prototype phase. Interested contributors should contact @Ads. This project reached a major milestone with Herald integration within Alberta, Canada’s contact tracing app TraceTogether v2.0, which went live on Tuesday.

//This update was compiled by @Sara D (thank you!) and we’d love to hear from all of you in the LFPH community how to evolve this new weekly feature. Thanks for reading!
